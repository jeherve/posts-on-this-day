Widget to display a list of posts published "on this day" in years past. A good little bit of nostalgia for your blog.

== Installation ==

* The usual. Go to Plugins > Add New, search, and install.
* You can then go to Appearance > Widgets or Appearance > Customize to set up your widget in one of your widget areas.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I want to customize the look of my widget =

You have 2 ways to do so.

1. You can add custom CSS to your site, targetting the `.posts_on_this_day` container and its contents to have the widget fit your needs.
2. If you're comfortable with PHP, you can add a code snippet that hooks into the `jeherve_posts_on_this_day_post_markup` filter to customize the look of each single post in the widget. That's a good way to change the size of the images displayed for each post, for example.
