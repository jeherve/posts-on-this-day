# Contributing

👍🎉 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉👍

- If you'd like to contribute but don't know where to get started, you can [take a look at existing issues](http://github.com/jeherve/posts-on-this-day/issues).
- To build the plugin, you'll need [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). Once you have it installed on your machine, run `composer install` to get the plugin's dependencies.
- You can check `composer.json` for commands you can use to help you work locally.
- If possible, add Unit Tests alongside any changes you may submit. See the `/tests` directory for some examples. To run the tests locally, run `composer test-php`.
